    "Welcome to the first assignment of week 2. In this assignment, you will:\n",
    "1. Learn to use Keras, a high-level neural networks API (programming framework), written in Python and capable of running on top of several lower-level frameworks including TensorFlow and CNTK. \n",
    "2. See how you can in a couple of hours build a deep learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are we using Keras? Keras was developed to enable deep learning engineers to build and experiment with different models very quickly. Just as TensorFlow is a higher-level framework than Python, Keras is an even higher-level framework and provides additional abstractions. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to finding good models. However, Keras is more restrictive than the lower-level frameworks, so there are some very complex models that you can implement in TensorFlow but not (without more difficulty) in Keras. That being said, Keras will work fine for many common models. \n",

    "In this exercise, you'll work on the \"Happy House\" problem, which we'll explain below. Let's load the required packages and solve the problem of the Happy House!"

In particular, rather than creating and assigning a new variable on each step of forward propagation such as `X`, `Z1`, `A1`, `Z2`, `A2`, etc. for the computations for the different layers, in Keras code each line above just reassigns `X` to a new value using `X = ...`. In other words, during each step of forward propagation, we are just writing the latest value in the commputation into the same variable `X`. The only exception was `X_input`, which we kept separate and did not overwrite, since we needed it at the end to create the Keras model instance (`model = Model(inputs = X_input, ...)` above). \n",

    "**Exercise**: Implement a `HappyModel()`. This assignment is more open-ended than most. We suggest that you start by implementing a model using the architecture we suggest, and run through the rest of this assignment using that as your initial model. But after that, come back and take initiative to try out other model architectures. For example, you might take inspiration from the model above, but then vary the network architecture and hyperparameters however you wish. You can also use other functions such as `AveragePooling2D()`, `GlobalMaxPooling2D()`, `Dropout()`. \n",

    "If your `happyModel()` function worked, you should have observed much better than random-guessing (50%) accuracy on the train and test sets. To pass this assignment, you have to get at least 75% accuracy. \n",

    "To give you a point of comparison, our model gets around **95% test accuracy in 40 epochs** (and 99% train accuracy) with a mini batch size of 16 and \"adam\" optimizer. But our model gets decent accuracy after just 2-5 epochs, so if you're comparing different models you can also train a variety of models on just a few epochs and see how they compare. \n",

    "until your height and width dimensions are quite low and your number of channels quite large (≈32 for example). You are encoding useful information in a volume with a lot of channels. You can then flatten the volume and use a fully-connected layer.\n",
    "- You can use MAXPOOL after such blocks. It will help you lower the dimension in height and width.\n",
    "- Change your optimizer. We find Adam works well. \n",
    "- If the model is struggling to run and you get memory issues, lower your batch_size (12 is usually a good compromise)\n",
    "- Run on more epochs, until you see the train accuracy plateauing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you have achieved 75% accuracy, please feel free to keep playing with your model to try to get even better results. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: If you perform hyperparameter tuning on your model, the test set actually becomes a dev set, and your model might end up overfitting to the test (dev) set. But just for the purpose of this assignment, we won't worry about that here.\n"
